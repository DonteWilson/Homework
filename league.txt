League of Legends Analysis

8/23/15

	In my game of League of Legends I managed to work along with others to destroy the nexus. I chose a high mobility character that can kite around 
enemy champions easily, while having high damage output. Basically I used the tools that were given to me, so that I can carry my team to victory. My 
final score of the game was 9/2/5 resulting in a victory over my opponents. My overall review of the game is that it is very team reliant. I chose the AD
Carry role, which relies on a support and a team to revolve around my pick. Most matches are played on a map called Summoners Rift, which is divided into red
and blue side. The game is split into three lanes consisting of mid, top, and bottom. The mid laner is usually a solo laner with high damage output and is focused 
heavily throughout the game. The top laner is usually has a tanky character build, which becomes the frontline of your team. Bottom lane consits of a duo, which has
one damage output and the other protecting the damage dealer. There is also the jungling role, which clears the jungle of your teams side and ganks other lanes, so 
that your team can stay ahead. In the game there are a total of 6 objectives that usually determine the outcome of the game. Those objectives consists of turrents,
dragons, barons, inhibitors, gold, and the nexus. The outcome of the game can be determined by the number of dragons you have over your enemy, the amount of turrents,
gold lead, and other common objectives. Every match of league that you play can be won, if your team is doing bad, then you just have to carry even harder. Therefore
league of legends is a well balanced game that consist of team related aspects and obstacles that you have to overcome.
