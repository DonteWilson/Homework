In terms of World of Warcraft, high warlord meant being the best of the best. It meant the world
to those who put their time and dedication into it. If you wanted to become a high warlord you 
must put your life into earning this achievement. This achievement couldn't be obtained by slacking
off or taking breaks. The more you didn't focus, the further you got pulled back from obtaining your
goal. Basically those who have this achievement put all their time and effort into earning it.
